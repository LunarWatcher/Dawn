1. Introduction                                              *dawn-template-intro*

This help document contains a short summary of the various supported
templates. The main document can be found at |dawn|

2. Vim                                                         *dawn-vim-template*

The Vim template is a fairly standard template that generates some placeholder
content for the autoload/, plugin/, and doc/ directories, as well as some
standard git files.

This template doesn't support any special arguments, and doesn't run any
commands.

================================================================================
3. C++                                                         *dawn-cpp-template*

The C++ template generates a semi-opinionated set of default files. Using
CMake, and C++20 as the language standard (which obviously can be changed by the
template user), it's a fairly normal template.

The template contains a "Hello, World!" program that compiles during template
generation. This is to validate the sanity of the build framework.

The template additionally comes with code for Conan, that's commented out by
default. Uncommenting this lets you configure conan very quickly, with the
help of cmake-conan: https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan

This template doesn't support any special arguments.
